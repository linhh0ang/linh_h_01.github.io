      <p><strong>"Parent"</strong>, Digital Video, 2 min <br>
        Paired with the video "Child", "Parent" represents the overbearing and stifling environments and relationships helicopter parents create when they take away a child's privacy and independence in favor of safety. Using the imagery of hurricanes viewed from space at a large scale, the video can bring upon a strange and ominous sense of peace. The final touch to this video is the use of a bright red filter, conveying anger, turmoil, and power. </p>

    <p><strong>"Child"</strong>, Digital Video, 2 min <br>
      Paired with the video "Parent", "Child" represents the feelings of those who were raised under the overwhelming care of helicopter parents. Not only is the video projected at a very small scale, it is filtered with a blue hue and shows in person footage of people witnessing the effects and destruction of a storm, representing sadness and powerlessness. The video can only be viewed when standing extremely close to the piece or with a magnifying, signifying that it takes a more keen eye to be able to pick up signs of when a child is going through struggles or abuse. </p>

      <p><strong>"Watching Over You"</strong>, Digital Video, 30 sec looped <br>
        What I was exploring with this project was the concept of surveillance, but instead of the typical cameras and FBI spies we link with the word "surveillance", I decided to use the eyes of the people that have watched over me throughout different parts of my life. Several of my pieces that I have made in this class place surveillance and the idea of being watched in a negative light, so with this exhibition piece, I decided to create something with a more positive feeling with the use of a subject more human and more colorful.</p>
