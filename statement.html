  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Hello! My name is Linh Hoang and I am currently a design student at SJSU. Art has always been both a creative and emotional outlet for myself, so what I really care about as an artist is being able to create pieces that express my thoughts, feelings, and ideas in a way that is colorful and abstract but still manages to strike emotional chords with viewers. Although I work with a variety of topics and themes in my work, a common thread that I have with a majority of my art is the concept of being watched and the fine line between having a caring eye looking out for you and having your privacy invaded by the ones watching you.
    <br>
    By creating collages of found footage and original footage, I was able to create express ideas using imagery of things that have a bit of an abstract take on the idea. My pieces also heavily relied on color to evoke certain emotional responses when viewing them. A majority of my pieces for this class had to do with surveillance or being watched, with "Cameras in Use" and "Parent & Child" having negative views on it and "Watching Over You" having a positive ones.
